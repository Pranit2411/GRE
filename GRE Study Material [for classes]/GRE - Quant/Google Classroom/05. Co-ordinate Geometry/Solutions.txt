Q3. (Draw for estimating)There are multiple ways to solve, i will illustrate the easiest. Because it is square we can first the point of intersection of diagonals using the mid-point formula. First find the midpoint using (-2, 3) and (3, 0).
x = (-2+3)/2 = 0.5
y = (3+0)/2 = 1.5
Assume the 4th point is (X,Y)
We should get the same midpoint using (-1,-1) and (X,Y)
x = 0.5 = (-1+X)/2
y = 1.5 = (-1+Y)/2
So, the 4th point (X,Y) = (2,4).
Other Method would be to simply calculating slopes for all options and using properties of parallel and perpendicular lines.



Q5. lets say the point on x axis is C (d,0)
Distance AC = Distance BC  ........use distance formula
1 equation 1 variable
solve for 'd'



Q6. naming the points
A(1,4)B(1,1)
C(3,2)use distance formula
AB = 3
AC = sq.root(8)
BC = sq.root(5)
perimeter = AB+BC+AC
use calculator to calculate the sq.roots



Q7. Label Lines
Line p y=x+2
Line q y=-2x+20
Line r y=4
Get points of intersection
Line p & Line q Point A (6,8)
Line q & Line r Point B (8,4)
Line r & Line p Point C (2,4)

Base in BC = 8-2 = 6
Height is = 8-4 = 4



Q15. Option A cannot be the answer as it is not in the 2nd quadrant.
Apply distance formula to find the radius of the circle.
Options B,C,D,E all have y co-ordinate 1.
We only have to find the X co-ordinate.
Apply Distance formula again. AB=AC (both are radius)



Q16. use slope formula. the variable 'a' will cancel out
