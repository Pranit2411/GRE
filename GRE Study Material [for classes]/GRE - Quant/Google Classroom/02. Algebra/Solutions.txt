Q3. (This question is difficult to prove so you can skip it)
We need two thing to prove the question and an intuitive idea what the answer could be
You should get a gut feeling that the answer is going to revolve around the number 9. So this number is important.
1. If two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by a number 'd' then their difference is divisible by that number 'd'.
2. Even after rearranging the digits, the remainder will remain the same if we are dividing by 9.

Proof 1: Assume two numbers n1 and n2 leave the same remainder 'r' when divided by 'd'
So we can write 
n1 = a*d + r ......where 'a' is an integer 
n2 = b*d + r ......where 'b' is an integer 
n1  -  n2 = (a-b)*d
(n1  -  n2) / d = (a-b) .....a-b is an integer
so we can say that (n1 - n2) will be divisible by 'd' if both n1 and n2 leave the same remainder when divided by 'd'

Proof 2: 
   part A:
The remainder when 'n' is divided by 'd' is equal to the remainder when (n-(a*d)) is divided by 'd', where 'a' is an integer.
(i am going to leave this part for students to prove and explore, it is easy, same concept as in Proof 1)
   part B:
lets assume that the 3 digit number is (100*a) + (10*b) + c
'c' is the digit in the units place
'b' is the digit in the tens place
'a' is the digit in the hundreds place
[ (100*a) + (10*b) + c ] % 9
[ ((99+1)*a) + ((9+1)*b) + c ] % 9
[ (99*a) + (9*b) + a + b + c ] % 9
[ a + b + c ] % 9 ..........from proof 2 part a
You can see that the remainder does not depend on the places of the digits 'a', 'b' and 'c'

Rearranging the digits 'a' 'b' and 'c' will yield the same remainder as [ a + b + c ] % 9
(this can be generalized for not only 3 digits but any number of digits)
Hence proved.
any number which is divisible by 9 is also divisible by 3.
Option A is the correct answer.



Q6. Let the number be x
x-21 = 71-x
x = (21+71)/2



Q10. so cube root of 18t must be an integer
18t = 2*3*3*t
so t must be t = 2*2*3 =12 <- answer
so that
18t = 2*3*3*t = 2*2*2*3*3*3
and so cube root of 18t will be 2*3



Q13. let the number be 10a+b
10a+b = k(a+b)
10b+a = w(a+b) ........we have to find w in terms of k
add both equation
11a+11b = (k+w)(a+b)
11(a+b) = (k+w)(a+b)
11 = k+w
w = 11-k



Q17. evaluate each bracket
(2/3) * (3/4) * (4/5) ........((n-1)/n)
almost everthing cancels out except numerator of first fraction and denominator of last fraction
= 2/n



Q19. Lets first name that charities -> A, B C
Each one has total of 8 members (but not all are different people)
4 are on all three charities (C1, C2, C3, C4)
Any 2 has 5 ppl common -> apart from C1 to C4 one more person is common (AB, BC, AC)
remaining are different
A -> C1,  C2,  C3,  C4,  AB,  AC,  A1,  A2
B -> C1,  C2,  C3,  C4,  AB,  BC,  B1,  B2
B -> C1,  C2,  C3,  C4,  AC,  BC,  C1,  C2
Total number of distinct ppl = 13



Q20. Check all options
A. (x+z)/z = integer + 1  = integer.......(x is a multiple of z)
B. (y+z)/x = y/z  +  z/x  = integer + z/x ......(z/x may not be an integer) 
C. (x+y)/z = integer ...... (x is a multiple of z) + (since, x is a factor of y -> y is a multiple of z)
D. (xy)/z = integer ..... (x is a multiple of z)
E. (yz)/x = integer .......(x is a factor of y)
So, Option B is the answer
