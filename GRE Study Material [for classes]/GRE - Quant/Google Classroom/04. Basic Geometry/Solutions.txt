Q1. triangle ABC similar to triangle EDC .....1  (using alternate angles and vertically opposite angles)
plot point G on AC such that BG is perpendicular to AC
triangle GBC similar to triangle FDC .....2  (using alternate angles and vertically opposite angles)
AC/CE = BC/CD  ..........from 1
BC/CD = 1/2
BC/CD = BG/DF ...............from 2
BG/DF = 1/2
BG = 2
area of ABC = 1/2  *  2  *  6 = 6



Q5. nothing about triangle NMP is given so we must consider all possibilities
Smallest possible MNP....area of shaded region will be greater than area of triangle.
biggest MNP...occurs when NMP is equilateral triangle.
assume radius to be 'R' calculate area of triangle in terms of R.
Calculate area of shaded region by subtracting area of NMP from area of circle.
Compare both areas.   still area of shaded region will be bigger...
SO Option B



Q7. Point O is on segment ST and no additional details is mentioned. It could be very near to the point S, midway of points S and T , on the top of point T
(The graphic is misleading)
Due to which the results may vary,
Hence option D



Q8. radius of small circle = 1 ..............from area
side of square = 2
diagonal of square = root (8)
diameter of big circle = root(8)
Area of larger circle = 2 (pi)
